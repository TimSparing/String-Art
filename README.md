# String-Art
Simple python and C code meant to take an image and create a string-art template to either be used manually or via a separate Arduino based device.

This code is based on the code from user [kaspar98](https://github.com/kaspar98/StringArt)

# Disclaimer
This code is just written for fun to solidify some knowledge and improve my coding
I can't guarantee that it is well written, the science checks out or that it is competent in any other way
